...and I heard it.

1097
01:44:16,789 --> 01:44:18,222
It?

1098
01:44:19,558 --> 01:44:21,492
A voice...

1099
01:44:23,095 --> 01:44:24,289
...your voice, Hermione...

1100
01:44:25,464 --> 01:44:27,091
...coming out of it.

1101
01:44:27,266 --> 01:44:31,100
- And what exactly did I say, may I ask?
- My name.

1102
01:44:31,704 --> 01:44:33,729
Just my name.

1103
01:44:34,506 --> 01:44:36,599
Like a whisper.

1104
01:44:38,577 --> 01:44:44,573
So I took it, clicked it,
and this tiny ball of light appeared.

1105
01:44:45,050 --> 01:44:46,483
And I knew.

1106
01:44:47,052 --> 01:44:51,682
And sure enough, it floated toward me,
the ball of light...

1107
01:44:53,392 --> 01:44:57,590
...went right to my chest,
straight through me. Right here.

1108
01:44:58,797 --> 01:45:02,790
And I knew it was gonna take me
where I needed to go, so I Disapparated...

1109
01:45:02,968 --> 01:45:05,232
...and came to this hillside.

1110
01:45:05,771 --> 01:45:08,296
It was dark. I had no idea where I was.

1111
01:45:08,841 --> 01:45:11,674
I just hoped
that one of you would show yourself.

1112
01:45:12,578 --> 01:45:14,102
And you did.

How long do you reckon
she'll stay mad at me?

1115
01:45:42,574 --> 01:45:45,907
Well, just keep talking about that
little ball of light touching your heart...

1116
01:45:46,078 --> 01:45:47,511
...and she'll come round.

1117
01:45:47,680 --> 01:45:50,410
It was true. Every word.

1118
01:45:52,217 --> 01:45:54,583
This is gonna sound crazy...

1119
01:45:55,054 --> 01:45:59,423
...but I think that's why Dumbledore
left it to me, the Deluminator.

1120
01:45:59,925 --> 01:46:04,919
I think he knew that somehow I'd need it
to find my way back, and she'd lead me.

1121
01:46:07,800 --> 01:46:10,530
Bloody hell, I just realized,
you need a wand, don't you?

1122
01:46:10,703 --> 01:46:13,194
- Yeah.
- I've got one here.

1123
01:46:13,472 --> 01:46:16,066
It's a blackthorn. Ten inches.

1124
01:46:16,241 --> 01:46:19,836
Nothing special, but I reckon it'll do.

but they're a bit dim, Snatchers.

1127

to Grindelwald. Look at the signature.

It's the mark again.

It keeps cropping up.

It was about something you were wearing
round your neck at the wedding. A symbol.

<i>winding road at twilight.</i>

<i>In time, the brothers reached a river</i>
<i>too treacherous to pass.</i>

1182
01:50:48,880 --> 01:50:50,745
<i>But being learned in the magical arts...</i>

1183
01:50:50,916 --> 01:50:56,081
<i>... the three brothers simply</i>
<i>waved their wands and made a bridge.</i>

1184
01:50:57,422 --> 01:50:59,515
<i>Before they could cross, however...</i>

1185

<i>... they found their path blocked</i>
by <i>a hooded figure.</i>

01:51:04,062 --> 01:51:07,930
<i>It was Death, and he felt cheated.</i>

1187
01:51:08,100 --> 01:51:11,160
<i>Cheated because travelers would</i>
<i>normally drown in the river.</i>

1188
01:51:11,336 --> 01:51:13,395
<i>But Death was cunning.</i>

1189

<i>He pretended to congratulate</i>
<i>the three brothers on their magic...</i>

1190
01:51:17,209 --> 01:51:22,476
<i>... and said that each had earned a prize for</i>
<i>having been clever enough to evade him.</i>

1191
01:51:23,048 --> 01:51:27,610
<i>The oldest asked for a wand</i>
<i>more powerful than any in existence.</i>

1192
01:51:27,786 --> 01:51:32,382
<i>So Death fashioned him one</i>
<i>from an elder tree that stood nearby.</i>

1193
01:51:33,792 --> 01:51:38,092
<i>The second brother decided he wanted</i>
<i>to humiliate Death even further...</i>

1194
01:51:38,263 --> 01:51:42,700
<i>... and asked for the power</i>
<i>to recall loved ones from the grave.</i>

1195
01:51:43,135 --> 01:51:47,435
<i>So Death plucked a stone from the river</i>
<i>and offered it to him.</i>

1196
01:51:48,173 --> 01:51:52,132
<i>Finally,</i>
<i>Death turned to the third brother.</i>

<i>A humble man...</i>

1198
01:51:54,946 --> 01:51:59,144
<i>... he asked for something that would</i>
<i>allow him to go forth from that place...</i>

1199
01:51:59,318 --> 01:52:02,481
<i>...without being followed</i> by <i>Death.</i>

1200
01:52:03,588 --> 01:52:09,458
<i>And so it was that Death reluctantly</i>
<i>handed over his own Cloak of Invisibility.</i>

1201
01:52:12,831 --> 01:52:15,766
<i>The first brother traveled</i>
<i>to a distant village...</i>

01:52:15,934 --> 01:52:18,027
<i>...where, with the Elder Wand in hand...</i>

1203
01:52:18,203 --> 01:52:21,969
<i>... he killed a wizard</i>
<i>with whom he had once quarreled.</i>

1204
01:52:24,176 --> 01:52:27,703
<i>Drunk with the power</i>
<i>that the Elder Wand had given him...</i>

1205
01:52:27,879 --> 01:52:30,973
<i>... he bragged of his invincibility.</i>

1206
01:52:33,985 --> 01:52:37,443
<i>But that night,</i>
<i>another wizard stole the wand...</i>

1207
01:52:37,622 --> 01:52:40,750
<i>... and slit the brother's throat</i>
<i>for good measure.</i>

1208

<i>And so Death took the first brother</i>
<i>for his own.</i>

<i>The second brother journeyed</i>
<i>to his home...</i>

1210
01:52:47,265 --> 01:52:50,234

<i>and turned it thrice in hand.</i>

<i>to marry before her untimely death...</i>

<i>... appeared before him.</i>

<i>Yet, soon she turned sad and cold</i>
<i>for she did not belong in the mortal world.</i>

<i>and give it to his son.</i>

Well, well, well,

It's Harry Potter.

He's all bright and shiny and new again,
just in time for the Dark Lord.

Call him.

Dobby has no master.
